## Effective Swift

Welcome to _Effective Swift_ -- an open source book that is modeled after the books _Effective C++_ and _Effective Java_.

Herein you will find a collection of items, each specifying one general rule, to help you write Swift code more effectively. For each rule I've attempted to provide relevant example code -- most of which is currently in production. This book is not designed to teach you the basics of Swift; for that you should refer to its excellent [language guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html). Nor is it designed to teach you fundamental principles like abstraction and decomposition; for that you should refer to a tome like [Code Complete](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670).

Currently the items in this book are assorted. It is my goal to add new items and eventually organize them into chapters. I also expect to rewrite and even delete items, both as a consequence of the Swift community acclimating to the language and establishing best practices, and as a consequence of the language itself evolving.

As a final note, _Effective C++_ and _Effective Java_ are two of my favorite technical books. I appreciate not only the soundness of their contents, but the brevity of their writing style. I hope that Effective Swift has the same value proposition. Please enjoy!
